</h1>

<p>
    Hosted in Prague in late winter every year, the WECEAF takes its leading
    role in developing core ideas in the field of elephant auto-fellatio very
    seriously. Our staggering attendeeship (last year we reached the milestone
    of 20 over the entire week!) proves as much. Key innovators and thought
    leaders come together to exchange ideas, grow networks and initiate
    friendships that last lifetimes.
