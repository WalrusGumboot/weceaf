            Ms. Ronié is no stranger to the WECEAF, but this year she has
            exciting new research to share. She will present her new book "Mijn
            werk, sterk werk". Building on a career of north of fifteen years,
            her extensive experience has allowed her to construct this talk for
            you. The central question: how can we introduce the miracle of EAF
            into the bigger picture?
